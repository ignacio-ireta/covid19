**COVID-19 Latin America Digital Repository**

**Project Description:**

This project aims to establish a comprehensive digital repository centralizing open-source COVID-19 data from the five largest countries in Latin America by land size, population size, and GDP; namely Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, México, and Perú. The focus is on three primary areas:

1. **Data Collection & Harmonization:**
     * Identifying and curating reliable sources of open COVID-19 data for each Latin American nation.
     * Downloading and cleaning datasets to ensure consistency, quality, and uniformity.
     * Implementing harmonization strategies to standardize formats, units of measurement, and codes.

2. **Data Analysis & Interpretation:**
    * Employing statistical techniques and visualizations to explore the data and gain insights into the pandemic's impact across the region.
    * Identifying trends, patterns, and anomalies.
    * Generating actionable insights regarding COVID-19 progression.

3. **Interactive Digital Repository Development:**
    * Designing and constructing an interactive repository enabling diverse users to explore and analyze the data.
    * Implementing visualization and interactive analysis tools (dashboards, maps, graphs).

**Methodology:**

The project will progress through the following phases:

1. **Planning & Design:**
    * Outline repository architecture and select tools.
    * Determine user needs and repository functionalities.
    * Create a project timeline and assign responsibilities.

2. **Data Collection & Harmonization:**
     * Implement an automated process to download and clean datasets.
    * Define a metadata schema describing the datasets.
    * Apply harmonization techniques to ensure data comparability.

3. **Data Analysis & Interpretation:**
    * Identify key variables and conduct statistical analysis.
    * Create data visualizations using graphs, maps, and other tools.
    * Interpret results and derive actionable insights.

4. **Repository Development:**
    * Build the repository's user interface.
    * Integrate visualization and analysis tools.
    * Deploy the repository and conduct usability testing.

5. **Evaluation & Dissemination**
    * Assess the impact of the repository on the community.
    * Share project findings through publications, presentations, and workshops.
